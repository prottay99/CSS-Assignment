            <h2>Bangladesh record 78 Covid-19 deaths</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/c.jpeg" alt="coronavirus">
            <p>Bangladesh on Sunday reported 78 Covid-19 deaths, the highest number of deaths in a single day, raising
                the
                total
                toll in the country to 9,739.
                A total of 29,376 samples were tested in the last 24 hours. The rate of detection was 19.81 percent.
                The health directorate today said a total of 4,212 patients recovered from the highly infectious disease
                in
                the last 24 hours, taking the number of total recovery to 576,590.
                The government yesterday reported 77 Covid-19 deaths which was the highest number of deaths in a single
                day.
                The government is mulling over an all-out lockdown for a week from 14 April to check coronavirus, an
                official of
                cabinet division told Prothom Alo on Sunday.</p>

            <h2>SSC and HSC exams 'uncertain' again</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/tt.jpg" alt="exam">
            <p>There is an uncertainty as to whether the examinations of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher
                Secondary Certificate (HSC) of this year will be held or not.

                Even, none of the authorities concerned could provide any info regarding this matter.

                The government had planned to arrange these examinations after taking a 60 and 80 day-long in-person
                classes
                both for SSC and HSC respectively, which was supposed to resume on 30 March. But the massive surge of
                Covid-19 infections has forced the government to continue the shutdown of educational institutions.

                Officials at Dhaka Education Board said it is not possible to declare a fresh timeframe for the
                examinations
                amid the current situation of Covid-19. But it completely depends on the decision of government’s
                high-ups
                whether the result of HSC will be drawn through assessment, based on previous classes’ results, in lieu
                of
                examination.

            <img src="assets/img/CROWED.jpg" alt="exam">
            <p>Three friends from Mohammadpur were buying cosmetics from the footpath in front of Chandni Chwak market
                in
                the capital. All of them had masks on their faces, but two have masks under their chins. The seller was
                also
                wearing a mask in a similar way.

                When asked about this, seller Abdul Zabbar instantly replied, “It’s hard to talk wearing a mask.”

                But Shaila Nazneen, one of the three friends, seemed to be a bit hesitant. She said, “I know that not
                wearing a mask is risky. However, I sometimes put down the mask to have fresh air.”

                On 5 April, the government imposed a week-long restrictions to contain the transmission of coronavirus.

            <h2>Keep factories open to avoid grave consequences</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/RMG_Workers.webp" alt="exam">
            <p>The country’s readymade garment (RMG) sector, the major foreign currency earner, has not yet recovered
                from
                the devastating effect of the first wave of the corona pandemic. We now very unfortunately have to cope
                with
                the second wave.
                While the factories were in operation, they strictly adhered to the implementation of proper health care
                measures and were successful in ensuring that their workers were well protected. As a result, and this
                was
                certainly true of all the Youngone factories, we have, relative to the situation outside, only had to
                deal
                with few cases of Covid, thanks to the precautionary measures taken. The situation was normal in the
                factories and corona positive cases were minimal. Even affected workers being relatively young, could
                come
                back to work in good health after 2-3 weeks of quarantine and healing.

            <h2>Covid in Dhaka city: Rupnagar, Adabor at highest risk</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/2.JPG" alt="exam">
            <p>Coronavirus transmission rate and casualties have been high in the capital city from the beginning.
                According
                to the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), 19 areas in the capital city are
                at
                highest risk of coronavirus transmission. The coronavirus transmission rate as compared to the number of
                tests in these areas fluctuates between 31 to 46 per cent. The risk of coronavirus transmission is
                highest
                in Rupnagar and Adabor area.
                <br>
                Apart from these areas, the transmission rate is over 20 per cent (21-30 per cent) in areas of 23 thanas
                is
                the city and more than 11 per cent in seven thanas.

            <h2>Lockdown:Thousands of restaurant workers jobless</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/hotel.jpg" alt="exam">
            <p>Zilani Jamaddar, hailing from Patuakhali district, would work at the Bhojonghar restaurant in Gulshan,
                Dhaka.
                As the government imposed a seven-day lockdown from 5 April, the Bhojonghar owner shut the restaurant,
                leaving Zilani and his colleagues unemployed.
                Zilani still bears the bitter experience of the 66-day shutdown the government had imposed during the
                first wave of coronavirus. That’s why, he left Dhaka soon after the government had enforced the
                lockdown.
                Abu Bakkar Siddique, former manager at Baishakhi, a Cox’s Bazar-based restaurant, has a similar story to
                tell. He lost his job too due to the lockdown. But he pays visit to his former job station regularly.
                Meeting the expense of his four-member family seems a challenge to him at present.
